## 📌 Module-wise Progress

> ### Module 1: Dataset Setup and Image Labeling
> **TASK:** Collect, inspect, and label dataset into 4 classes:  
> wrinkles, dark spots, puffy eyes, clear skin  
> **RESULT:** Dataset cleaned, labeled, and verified;  
> balanced class distribution achieved  

> ### Module 2: Image Preprocessing, Augmentation, and One-Hot Encoding
> **TASK:** Resize images to 224x224, normalize pixels,  
> apply augmentation (flip, rotation, zoom), and encode labels  
> **RESULT:** All images preprocessed and augmented;  
> labels one-hot encoded; dataset ready for training  

> ### Module 3: EfficientNetB0-based Image Classification (Training & Evaluation)
> **TASK:** Train pretrained EfficientNetB0 with categorical cross-entropy  
> and Adam optimizer; monitor accuracy/loss metrics  
> **RESULT:** Model trained; achieved ~98% test accuracy;  
> validation stable; training curves plotted  

> ### Module 4: Face Detection and Prediction Pipeline (Haar Cascade Experiment)
> **TASK:** Apply OpenCV Haar Cascade for face detection and crop regions  
> for model input  
> **RESULT:** Haar Cascade detected faces inconsistently;  
> reduced classification accuracy; excluded from final pipeline  

> ### Module 5: Web UI for Image Upload and Visualization
> **TASK:** Design frontend interface using HTML/CSS; implement image upload  
> and prediction preview  
> **RESULT:** Pending implementation  

> ### Module 6: Backend Pipeline for Model Inference
> **TASK:** Modularize inference code to load model and return predictions to UI  
> **RESULT:** Pending implementation  

> ### Module 7: Testing, Generalization, and Result Validation  
> **TASK:** Evaluate the trained model on diverse real-world images beyond the training dataset to test generalization.
> **RESULT:** Model successfully tested on unseen images; demonstrated good generalization ability. Predictions were consistent across different inputs, and results were validated using screenshots.

> ### Module 8: Documentation and Final Presentation  
> **TASK:** Prepare user/developer guides, GitHub repository documentation, and presentation materials  
> **RESULT:** Pending implementation
